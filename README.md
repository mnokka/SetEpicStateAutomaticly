# SetEpicStateAutomaticly
When new Story has added to Epic, change Epic state back to In Progress  
 
Epic forward movements are following automaticly linked Stories movements. This listener will implement "In case Epic has new Story added, it state should be changed automaticly to back to In Progress state". Workflow do have buttons for this but automation is needed
